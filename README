Tornado web server is an async web server open sourced by Facebook.

Sphinx is an open source search engine.

I built this website in order to learn Tornado + Sphinx + Python + Facebook API + Google Map API.

It also uses the geolocation property from HTML5 to determine your location.

Now the website is deployed on Amazon Web Service. http://www.tornadopy.info
